## What Have I Done:
I've made this snake game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've also used modernizr.js for get fast response of browser and I've created another reset.css file for start the game from beginning.

Modernizr is a collection of superfast tests – or “detects” as we like to call them – which run as your web page loads, then you can use the results to tailor the experience to the user.


## Required Skills:
- Basic HTML
- Basic CSS
- Intermediate JavaScript


## Usage:
- First of all you need to put the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files in the same folder.
- Then open the index.html file in any browser.
- You're done! Enjoy the game.
- You need to use arrow keys for control the snake.
