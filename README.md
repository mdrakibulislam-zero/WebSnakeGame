## What Have I Done:
I've made this snake game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've also used modernizr.js for get the fast response of browser and I've created another reset.css file for start the game from beginning instantly.

Modernizr is a JavaScript library that detects the features available in a user's browser. This lets web pages avoid unsupported features by informing the user their browser isn't supported or loading a polyfill.
